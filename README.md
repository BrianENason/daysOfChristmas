# daysOfChristmas

This project was created as a way to practice Python Dictionaries.

To run it, simply download the .py file and run it through command line.

This was created and tested in a windows environment.

All changes/input are welcomed as long as there is a comment as to why the change needs to be made!

Thank you and Merry Christmas!!
